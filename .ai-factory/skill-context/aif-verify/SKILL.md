## Rules

### Requirements Package Acceptance
**Source**: manual, 2026-10-05
**Rule**: If the plan references `requirements/<NNNN>-<slug>/`, verify every AC (and FR/BR/EC) ID **in the plan's scope** (the `Milestone scope` in Requirements Reconciliation; whole package when absent) from its `feature.md` / `prd.md` against the code and tests; IDs of other milestones are not checked; report each uncovered or contradicted ID as a requirements-provenance failure. UI states promised in the package (loading / empty / error) must exist in the implemented views. For change packages, verify that the old behavior listed in "Было → станет" is actually gone.

### Skill Convention Compliance
**Source**: manual, 2026-10-05
**Rule**: For files created or modified by tasks with a `**Skill:**` field, spot-check the result against that skill's `references/RULES.md` (naming prefixes, OpenAPI attributes, strict types, readonly DTOs, `<script setup lang="ts">`, no `any`, etc.). For Laravel services/modules touched by the plan, run `laravel-review-service-structure` / `laravel-review-module-structure` when available. For NestJS, check the general rules of `nestjs-code` and the anti-patterns of `nestjs-specialist`: relative imports with `.js`, no `any` / non-null assertions, one route per HTTP controller, transactions and outbox only in use-cases, tenant only from `RequestContext`, RLS + `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` on every tenant table, consumers through the inbox.

### Documentation Freshness
**Source**: manual, 2026-10-05
**Rule**: Verify that CLAUDE.md files of every touched module/service/frontend directory were regenerated after the code changes (documented components match files on disk). Stale docs are a WARN in normal mode and a FAIL in `--strict`.

### Quality Gates Through the Makefile
**Source**: manual, 2026-10-05 (replaces "Build and Tests Inside Docker")
**Rule**: Run the project's gates via Makefile targets on the host: `make lint`, `make analyse`, `make test`, `make test-integration`, `make front` (or their equivalents listed in the Makefile help). NestJS uses the same target names: `lint` = ESLint + Prettier check, `analyse` = `tsc --noEmit`, `test` = Vitest unit, `test-integration` = Vitest integration + http on Testcontainers; `front` only when the repository has a frontend. Never run the test suite inside the `app` container. If the plan touches UI (views, components, routes) also run `make test-browser`; e2e scenarios run only locally against the isolated e2e contour and are a merge gate even though CI does not run them. A missing Makefile target is reported as WARN with the exact command used instead.

### Traceability Matrix Gate
**Source**: manual, 2026-10-05
**Rule**: Build a matrix from the requirements package for the plan's scope: every in-scope AC ID → at least one passing test whose name starts with that ID (Pest title / PHPUnit TestDox or `test_ac_N_` method under `tests/Unit|Feature|Integration`, pytest `test_ac_N_` function, Vitest `it('AC-N: …')` in `src/**/*.spec.ts` / `test/**`, Playwright under `tests/Browser`); every UC ID with a UI → a Playwright `test.describe('UC-N: …')` (or file header reference) covering its main flow and each alternative/error flow. Print the matrix in the report. Uncovered AC/UC = FAIL in `--strict`, WARN otherwise. Requirements listed as waived in the package README are reported as WAIVED, not FAIL.

### Milestone Completion
**Source**: manual, 2026-10-05
**Rule**: When the plan has `## Roadmap Linkage` and the traceability matrix is fully covered (or WAIVED), report the milestone as complete; if `/aif-implement` did not mark it, suggest `/aif-roadmap check`. If the milestone is already marked done but the matrix is not fully covered (and not WAIVED), report FAIL in `--strict` (WARN otherwise) and suggest `/aif-roadmap` to uncheck it.

### Error Tracking Gate
**Source**: manual, 2026-10-12
**Rule**: When the project uses GlitchTip (`sentry/sentry-laravel`, `@sentry/vue`, `sentry-sdk` or `@sentry/nestjs` present), check: DSNs are empty in `phpunit.xml`/pytest/Vitest config, `compose.override.yml`, `compose.e2e.yml` and `.env.example`; production compose lists the `SENTRY_*` variables by name; the scrubber and user-context tests pass; new entry points from this plan report their errors. Missing items are WARN (FAIL in `--strict`). When the project has no integration yet, report WARN `[error-tracking] not integrated` and suggest a milestone for it.

### Test Levels in Verification
**Source**: manual, 2026-10-30 (verdeect-identity)
**Rule**: The test gate is `make test-full` (or `test` + `test-integration` + `test-timing` when the target is missing — WARN `[test-levels] missing targets`), plus `test-browser` / `test-visual` per the other rules. `test-timing` needs a quiet machine: when load average ≥ 8 (or above the number of cores), report it as DEFERRED with the measured value instead of FAIL, and list it under open items. A test that fails by timeout under load and passes when re-run alone is reported as FLAKY-UNDER-LOAD with file, test and duration — never silently dropped. In `--strict` it is FAIL if a file that writes env, mocks modules or patches prototypes runs in the `shared` (non-isolated) project, or if the hashing cost of the test configuration leaks into production compose / `.env.example`.

### Browser Tests Without a Vue Stack
**Source**: manual, 2026-10-15
**Rule**: "The plan touches UI" includes React/TSX pages and any other browser application in the repository, not only Vue views. For such plans run `make test-browser` and require in the traceability matrix a Playwright `test.describe('UC-N: …')` for every in-scope UC with UI. A NestJS repository with a browser application is not a "backend-only service": missing e2e contour or missing UC specs are FAIL in `--strict`.

### Visual Regression Against Mockups
**Source**: manual, 2026-10-21
**Rule**: When the requirements package has exported mockups and the plan touches UI, run `make test-visual` (see the aif-plan rule of the same name). In `--strict` it is FAIL if: the run is red; the contour (`playwright.visual.config.ts`, `tests/Visual/`, Makefile target, CI job) is missing; an artboard of the plan's screens is missing from the catalog; `tests/Visual/deviations.ts` got entries without a recorded user approval in the plan; baselines, `threshold` or `maxDiffPixels` were changed to make tests pass. Report the path to the diff images. Add "artboard → visual test" to the traceability matrix.

### Library Package Gates
**Source**: manual, 2026-10-27 (verdeect-platform-client, adapted from verdeect-auth)
**Rule**: This repository is a published npm library. Quality gates are `make lint analyse test build pack-check` (or `make ci`); for the milestone with contract tests and before a release also `make test-contract` (requires Docker and `../verdeect-platform`; report the Platform commit used). Targets `test-integration`, `front`, `test-browser`, `test-visual` do not exist here and are not reported as missing. "Error Tracking Gate" does not apply. Additionally FAIL in `--strict` if: `exports["./testing"]` has a `default` condition or the main or `./nest` entry imports from `testing`; the core entry imports `@nestjs/*`; `@verdeect/auth` or `@nestjs/*` is listed in `dependencies`; a public `.d.ts` imports from `zod`; the tarball contains `src/`, specs, maps or config files; a file copied from `verdeect-platform` lacks its source header; a public export changed without a matching `CHANGELOG.md` entry.
